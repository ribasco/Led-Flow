# Features
- Define a chain of led activity configurations that you can assign, reuse and playback for any led instance.
- Gives you more flexibility in controlling the light patterns for complex activities
- Fluent API Interface
- Non-blocking

2. Navigate to the libraries folder
3. Clone the repository into the libraries folder 

	`git clone https://github.com/ribasco/Led-Flow.git`

4. Restart the Arduino IDE (If open)
5. In your sketch, include the library by typing

```
#include <LedFlow.h>

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:

}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```
or simply via the Arduino Menu
